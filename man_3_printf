.br

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.SH Format of the format string
The format string is composed of 0 or more directives (ordinary characters that are not %), which are copied to the output stream. The format string is also composed of conversion specifications, each of which result in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character % and ends with the conversion specifier.
The argument must correspond properly with the conversion specifier. By default, the arguments are used in the order given.
.SH The conversion specifier
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, then the resulting character is written
.TP
.B s

.TP
.B S
Prints a string. Non printable characters are printed as "\x" followed by their ASCII values in two digit hexadecimal
.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B x, X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned lowercase hexadecimal notation(x), or unsigned uppercase hexadecimal notation(X).
.TP
.B u
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned decimal notation
.TP
.B o, b
